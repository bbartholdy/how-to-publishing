## So you want to publish your thesis?

class: center,middle

## Authorship

A somewhat controversial aspect of publishing... `r ji("cry")`

--

A typical journal article:

.list-left[
- **first author:** Main contributor (you)
- **last author:** Supervisor
- **middle:** order can be meaningful, but often irrelevant
]

**Supervision does not guarantee co-authorship**  
Although, if they helped you develop the original research project and
provided significant reviews of your work, they should be involved in the 
publication.

## Co-authors

`r ji("muscle")` Make sure they pull their weight  
`r ji("running")` Co-authorship has to be earned  
`r ji("clap")` And give credit where credit is due

.list-left[
- **Co-authorship:** significant contribution to the research, and/or manuscript
preparation.
- **Acknowledgements:** People who provided help in a limited form. (remember to thank your reviewers!)
]

Most journals will have a policy for authorship

Unfortunately, there is often politics and hierarchy involved...

## Preparing a manuscript

[Open academics](https://www.oacommunity.org/resources)

--

.list-left[

Use a <b>reference manager</b> (if you don't already)

- I use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (because it's awesome and free!)
]

--

.list-left[
Version control

- First draft, version 1, final version, published, etc.
- If a heavily revised manuscript gets rejected, you may want to re-use stuff
  that was removed from a previous version

Cross-reference tables and figures `r ji("warning")`

- Trust me, it'll make your life easier...
]

--

`r ji("exclamation")`**GUIDELINES**`r ji("exclamation")`


Read the <b>guidelines</b> for your target journal  
Not following the <b>guidelines</b> is a quick way to get rejected


---
class: center,middle

## Preparing a manuscript

Don't worry too much about formatting, this is what publishers are paid to do

...but still follow the <b>guidelines</b>

**Read articles from your target journal**

--

### Supplementary material

If you think something is important but doesn't really fit in the manuscript.

Additional tables, graphs, data, code scripts, etc.

---
class: center,middle

## Submitting a manuscript

The submission process can take longer than expected

--

After finishing the manuscript, there may still be a lot to do

--

.list-left[
For example: 

- Fill in the online form
 + word count, table and figure count, and other formalities
- Keywords (don't underestimate the importance)
- Separate figures and tables from manuscript (usually)
- Cover letter to the editor

## Reviews

Peer-review can be intimidating, but will ultimately improve your paper (most of the time...)

You will often be required to <b>track changes</b>

Comments are not personal (most of the time...)

.pull-left[
> <a quote> "35-49 years , rather than 35-48" </a>

> <a quote> "Commonly, when bone surface lesion is being assessed, the researcher must set a sort of lower limit for unusual features, which if not met will indicate that the condition was absent. Such information should be mentioned." </a>

]

.pull-right[
> <a quote> "I find the information about treatment irrelevant to the osteoarchaeological analysis." </a>

> <a quote> "one gets the feeling the paper was hurridly put together without giving much thought to the details" </a>

]

## Rejection

--

Everyone has had a paper rejected. <b>EVERYONE</b>.

--

<b>Don't panic</b>. Use the (useful) comments and resubmit to a different journal

Reproducibility vs. replication (often, wrongfully, conflated).

**Reproducibility:** Does the same analysis on the same data give the same result?

**Replication:** Does the same analysis on different data give the same result?

Leiden University has .open[open access] agreements with the following publishers:

E(vil)sevier  
Wiley  
Springer  
And [more](https://www.library.universiteitleiden.nl/researchers/open-access/agreements-with-publishers)...

--

These agreements allow (first-)authors from Leiden University to publish .open[open 
access] in their journals at no cost.

Other journals will require a fee (APC) to publish .open[open access].

Make sure to discuss this with co-authors and the head of lab/curator first. 
You should be on the same page.
